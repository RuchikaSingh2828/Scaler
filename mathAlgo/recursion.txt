Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution 
depenends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

Why?
- A great technique to simplify your solution
- if you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller 
version of the same problem, recursion is very useful
============================================================
Every recursion solution needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion
